# ü©∫ ECG Signal Processing and Classification

## üöÄ Project Overview
This project focuses on developing a robust pipeline for **Electrocardiogram (ECG) signal processing**, **feature extraction**, and **classification** to detect cardiac arrhythmias using both **traditional machine learning (SVM)** and **deep learning models (CNN, LSTM)**. The goal is to automate the detection of abnormal rhythms, improving early diagnosis and reducing reliance on manual interpretation by analyzing ECG signals from the **MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database**.

## ü©∫ Why This Project?
### üìå **Motivation**
Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death globally. Timely diagnosis of heart conditions such as **arrhythmias** is crucial. ECG monitoring is a **non-invasive** and **cost-effective** method to detect heart abnormalities, but manual interpretation can be **time-consuming** and **error-prone**.

Automating ECG signal classification can:
- Help in **early diagnosis**.
- Reduce **human error**.
- Provide **real-time monitoring** in **wearable devices**.

- Dataset: [MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database](https://physionet.org/content/mitdb/1.0.0/)
- 48 half-hour excerpts of two-channel ambulatory ECG recordings.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Signal Preprocessing**
- **Noise Removal** using a **Bandpass Butterworth Filter (0.5 Hz - 40 Hz)**.
- Down-sampling (if needed).
